# codechef-ranklist-scrape

Scraping ranklists of ACM ICPC Online contests 2014 conducted by Codechef.

### Problem tackled

CodeChef was providing the team results without any search filter and a user had to manually keep going to the next page to check their team's rank. I recursively scraped every page to counter the hassle of accessing every page.

I posted the links to the Codechef-Discuss platform and got a total of 376 visits for Kharagpur ranklist and 259 visits for Kanpur Online Contests. I shared the results using Github gists and tracked visits using Google URL shortener analytics.
